PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repository contains the project work for analyzing and visualizing data. Below you will find an overview of the project, business understanding, data understanding and analysis, conclusions and organizations of the project files. 

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Microsoft Studio has made a decision to launch a new movie studio and enter into the film business industry.   They don't have the skills or the expertise to make successful movies that will help them to earn more profits like other production companies at the Box Office. They must comprehend the current trends and tastes of movies, that will be liked by their targeted consumers, in order to make wise selections regarding the kinds of movies to produce. 

This project's goal and objective is to investigate the kinds of movies that are currently doing well at the Box Office and offer useful information that Microsoft can use to decide what kinds of movies to make. The findings that will be made from the analysis will be applied by Microsoft’s new movie studio with the aim of producing good movies and films that have a potential to be successful in the market.  The key stakeholder in this project is the Microsoft Studio. We aim to answer the following business questions: -
1.	Which movies are doing well in the industry?
2.	Which genre of movies are doing in the current market in the film industry?
3.	Which movies would you recommend Microsoft to produce, which will earn them more profits in the future?

DATA UNDERSTANDING
Data Sources and Description
In this project, we used data from other movie and film production companies, such as Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and The MovieDB. These data samples were imported into our databases of which we used them to determine the current movies and the genres that are currently doing well in the market. 

The data contains movie title, the studio production, domestic gross, foreign gross, the year that they were produced and the number of votes and reviews that were reviewed by their targeted consumers after watching them. 

CONCLUSION
Throughout our analysis, we found the following relevant findings:

1.	The movie “Beautiful Boy[2018]” has been performing well since it has earned the company with over $8.7million worldwide.
2.	The movie genre “Drama” has been performing well since it has earned the company with over 1.2 million votes worldwide after watching the movie genres.
3.	The movies “Kid with a bike, Desierto and Once Upon A time in Anatolia” might do well in the future after being produced by the new Microsoft studio. 

Based on the findings above, I would like to recommend Microsoft to produce the movie Beautiful Boy[2018] since it has earned the other production companies with over $8.7 million of which this will earn, the new Microsoft studio, more profits as compared to other movies.
